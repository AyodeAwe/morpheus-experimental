# Morpheus Experimental

Morpheus Experimental is a staging/collaboration/experimental area for development. This directory contains prototypes of cybersecurity workflows and pipelines which are still being developed and are in the alpha testing stage. Please be advised that the pipelines in Morpheus Experimental are subject to change.

Prototype contributions from the community are welcome. A prototype should include at minimum a tutorial-style notebook, model file, sample data, training script, inference script, and documentation. 

## Repo Structure
Every prototype has its own directory that contains everything belonging to the specific prototype. Directories can include the following subfolders:

### models
Model files for public release (ONNX preferred to pytorch/tensorflow)

### datasets

Sample of training data and inference dataset (input and output files) to be used to test pipeline

### training-tuning

A script showing how to train or fine-tune the model. It takes sample training data file as an input and creates a model file. It is reliable and repeatable (ie. set seed values). If variables are used in script (ie. epochs, learning_rate) set defaults to those used to achieve metrics reported in documentation. It includes a `requirements.txt` file with dependencies and versions used for training. 

### inference

A non-morpheus pipeline script that contains data loading, preprocessing, model loading, inference, postprocessing, and serialized output file. It uses desired morpheus pipeline variables as input variables to the script (ie. threshold=0.6). It produces a reliable and repeatable output file from the inference dataset. It includes `requirements.txt` file with dependencies and versions used for non-morpheus inference.

### morpheus pipeline (optional)
All the necessary files for a full Morpheus pipeline of the prototype similiar to pipelines found in Morpheus Examples https://github.com/nv-morpheus/Morpheus/tree/branch-22.09/examples

# Current Cybersecurity Workflow Prototypes

## DGA Detection via AppShield
This model is a convolution neural network model trained to classify URL domains generated by Domain-Generation-Algorithms. Domain generation algorithms (DGA) are algorithms seen in various families of malware that are used to periodically generate a large number of domain names that can be used as rendezvous points with their command and control servers.

## Phishing URL Detection via AppShield
### Model Overview
This model is a binary classifier to label phishing URLs and non-phishing URLs obtained from host process data.
